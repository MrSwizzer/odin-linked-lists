# ðŸ”— Linked List Project

This project is part of **The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum**, focusing on implementing **Linked Lists** from scratch. A linked list is a fundamental data structure that connects nodes in a sequence, where each node points to the next one in the list.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- Built a **Singly Linked List** data structure in JavaScript.
- Implemented basic methods like **`append`**, **`prepend`**, **`insertAt`**, and **`removeAt`**.
- Created methods to **search** and **display** elements in the list.
- Wrote a function to **reverse the linked list**.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6)**: To implement the linked list and its methods.

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Outcomes

- Learned the mechanics of **Linked Lists** and how they differ from arrays.
- Improved understanding of **node-based structures** and how to manipulate them using pointers (references).
- Implemented methods to traverse, search, and modify a linked list.
